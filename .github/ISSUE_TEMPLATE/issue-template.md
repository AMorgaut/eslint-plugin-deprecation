<!-- PLEASE READ THIS FIRST -->

<!--
This plugin is a direct copy-past from the SonarJs repository
to make it available for general public to use outside of the SonarJs.

This means that I, even being the owner of this repository, am not the owner of the code
nor did I spend any significant amount of time to understand it.

Which brings me to the same spot as you are - I am not capable to address your issue.

So the best choice would be if you can and want is to try and fix the issue yourself via a PR.

You may still open an issue here to track it however do not expect a fix any time soon =)

Cheers!
